<p>If the mission for ResearchOps is to help researchers do their best work, then the mission of the ResearchOps Community is to help research operations people know just how to do that.</p>
<p>In effect, we research the researchers. We talk about and influence the development of tools, repositories, guidelines and templates. Discussing what makes the best lab, what kinds of spaces researchers need to do their work, how to do the best recruitment.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re here for the Ops people, and in turn, the researchers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a vibrant, global Community centred around our Slack which is carefully tended and managed by a team of committed board members and organisers of our global projects.</p>

  <h2>Rules of Conduct</h2>
  <p>Being a community requires a commitment to being respectful of our incredibly diverse and global Community. We have <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z1nUCGQNYF_zzYE2TWBOEWDpu1kFfwoKVQ6xtLWdQvg/edit#heading=h.5ox9hph8nxba">a public Community Guidelines document</a> that includes a Code of Conduct.</p>
  <p>Impressively, the community is actually just warm, collegiate and inclusive all by itself. When it isn&rsquo;t, the Cheese Board are ready to help (better yet, because of the global nature of the group, there&rsquo;s always one of us on hand, should you need anything).</p>
  <p>Outside the Slack, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:teamreops@gmail.com"></a>teamreops@gmail.com</p>
