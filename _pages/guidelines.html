<p class="introduction">The ResearchOps Community provides spaces for researchers, designers and others to describe and democratize how research is operationalised within organizations. Our community guidelines are here to facilitate an environment where members feel welcome to engage in conversation.</p>

<h1>Code of conduct</h1>
<p>The ResearchOps Community is committed to maintaining a safe, welcoming, harassment-free environment for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. This code of conduct applies to anyone who participates in a space affiliated with the ResearchOps Community, including our Slack as well as any network activities, events, and forums (both online and off).</p>

<h2>What we strive for</h2>
<p>We strive to promote an open exchange of ideas balanced by thoughtful guidelines. If we have only openness, community members on the receiving end of thoughtless or intentionally hurtful behavior may withdraw or leave the community. We want to prevent thatreasonably withdraw. On the other hand, overly intrusive guidelines may stifle communication or make people feel unwelcome. It&rsquo;s up to every member to foster a culture that balances openness, honesty, and mutual respect.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to list everything you can do to help create a more welcoming space, and we know this community will find ways to include people that we&rsquo;ve yet to consider. When in doubt, rely on the following principles for guidance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be humble, practice empathy and humility</li>
  <li>Assume competence</li>
  <li>Listen carefully and actively</li>
  <li>Ask questions, and seek to understand context</li>
  <li>Encourage other people to listen as much as they speak</li>
  <li>Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from conversations about design, research, and technology</li>
</ul>

<h2>Behavior we don&rsquo;t accept</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of actions that violate our community guidelines andt run counter to the our community&rsquo;s culture.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Product, service, or event evangelism. We wish to foster a holistic dialog around research operations rather than one centered around products, services, and events. If you&rsquo;re keen to discuss a specific product or service, please join #product-and-services. For events or conferences that are not organized by ReOps community admins (see below), please join #events.</li>
  <li>Surveying, canvassing, or offering promotions to community members. We take the attention of this community seriously. Please contact a Slack admin (see below) before soliciting broad input or offering discounts to members.</li>
  <li>Unwelcome verbal or written comment or physical conduct that is so objectively offensive that it creates a hostile environment; when it is based on: race, religion, color, sex (with or without sexual conduct and including pregnancy and sexual orientation involving transgender status/gender identity, and sex-stereotyping), national origin, age, disability, genetic information, parental status, marital status, or political affiliation.</li>
  <li>
    Negative or offensive remarks based on:
    <ul>
      <li>gender expression</li>
      <li>mental illness</li>
      <li>socioeconomic status or background</li>
      <li>neuro(a)typicality</li>
      <li>physical appearance</li>
      <li>body size</li>
      <li>or clothing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Touching people without their affirmative consent.</li>
  <li>Consistent disruption of meetings, talks, or discussions.</li>
  <li>Intentionally or repeatedly referring to people in a way that rejects the validity of their racial or gender identity; for instance, by using incorrect pronouns or forms of address (misgendering).</li>
  <li>
    Micro-aggressions: small comments or questions, either intentional or unintentional, that marginalize people by communicating hostile, derogatory, or negative beliefs. Examples include:
    <ul>
      <li>Patronizing language or behavior.</li>
      <li>Pedantic corrections that don&rsquo;t contribute to the conversation. For example, correcting someone who says “user testing” when that person clearly meant “usability testing.”</li>
      <li>Assuming without asking that particular people or groups need concepts defined or explained to them. (It&rsquo;s great to be sensitive to the fact that people may not be familiar with technical terms you use every day, but assuming that people are uninformed can come across as patronizing.)</li>
      <li>Assuming that particular groups of people are technically unskilled ("So easy your grandmother could do it.")</li>
      <li>Repeatedly interrupting or talking over someone else</li>
      <li>Feigning surprise at someone&rsquo;s lack of knowledge or awareness about a topic</li>
      <li>The use of racially charged language to describe an individual or thing such as "thug" or “ghetto.”</li>
      <li>Mocking someone&rsquo;s real or perceived accent or first language.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Retaliating against anyone who complains that someone has violated these guidelines.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>We respect the privacy of people who choose to participate in our community. As a general guide, please observe the Chatham House Rule: “Participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.”</p>

<h1>How this works in practice</h1>
<p>If something has happened to make you feel unsafe, unwelcome, or excluded, or if you observe behavior that appears to make others feel unsafe, unwelcome, or excluded, please contact an administrator. They will help decide the appropriate course of action to resolve the problem. </p>

<h2>Slack admins</h2>
<p>The ResearchOps Slack is administered by Kate Towsey and Andrew Maier. Please contact either of them for violations of our guidelines from someone in our Slack.</p>

<h2>Community admins</h2>

Community administrators reserve the right to ask anyone in violation of these guidelines not to participate in Research Ops network activities, events, and digital forums. In some cases we will actively ban offenders.</p>
