        <p>We&rsquo;re a global group of people who&rsquo;ve come together to discuss the operations and operationalization of user research and design research &mdash; also known as ResearchOps. ResearchOps includes the people, mechanisms, and strategies that set research in motion.</p>

        <p>We believe that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ResearchOps is an emergent consequence of knowledge work at scale</li>
          <li>Scaling the operation of research requires specific skills and attention to corporate memory</li>
          <li>Our collective experience holds the keys to building capability within the profession</li>  
        </ul>
        
        <p>This website is a record of the work we&rsquo;ve done, and continue to do, to grow ResearchOps as a discipline, to create a shared language and shared resources for people who undertake the operational side of research.</p>
