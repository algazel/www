        <h1>About</h1>
        
        <p>We&rsquol;re a global community discussing ResearchOps &mdash; the people, mechanisms, and strategies that organizations use to scale their design and user research practice. Our Community began on the 8th of March, 2018 with a tweet from Kate Towsey.</p>
        <p>In addition to maintaining our Slack, our community is committed to facilitating global discussions via local workshops. Our <a href="https://medium.com/researchops-community/researchops-community-a-series-of-global-workshops-d48058ece814">first workshop series</a> helped us better define the discipline. In 2019, we’re running two more.</p>

        <section id="what">
          <h2>What is ResearchOps?</h2>          
          <p>Working as a user researcher, design researcher, etc. means paying attention to things outside of research itself: liaising with stakeholders; managing ethics applications and consent forms; managing data; organising the why, when, and how much — and this is all before you’ve even started the research!</p>
          <p>This is where ResearchOps begins. ResearchOps is an emergent consequence of knowledge work at scale. As an organization scales its research practice, it must also scale the operations of its research.</p>
          <p>What does that entail, you might ask? We wondered the same thing. After our global series of workshops in 2018 (where we asked the question, “what is ResearchOps?”) we arrived at the following definition:</p>
          <blockquote>“ResearchOps is the people, mechanisms, and strategies that set user research in motion. It provides the roles, tools and processes needed to support researchers in delivering and scaling the impact of the craft across an organisation.”</blockquote>

        <section id="why">
          <h2>Why operationalize research</h2>
          <p>Why is research ops important? There are lots of reasons given in/implied by the framework. Some of the most notable include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Protecting participant privacy</li>
            <li>Bias</li>
            <li>Ethics</li>
            <li>Legal</li>
            <li>Making research easier to do (i.e. “democratizing” research)</li>
            <li>Operationalizing respect for the people who participate in our research</li>
            <li>Magnifying the impact of our research (knowledge sharing)</li>  
          </ul>
          <p>Why should someone specialize in ops? ResearchOps is related to research, but distinct; and not all ResearchOps professionals (for example, participant recruiters or research librarians) are professional researchers. ResearchOps is important in its own right. Just as a professional violinist benefits from a good violin, so too do researchers benefit from dedicated attention to ResearchOps. Researchers need tools and processes that work. Your research and the people who give you their time deserve it.</p>
          <p>ResearchOps is an emergent profession in its own right. People who practice ResearchOps help researchers do their best work.</p>

          <h2>What are we doing now?</h2>
          
          <p>A community of more than 2,000 people never stops. Our work emerges according to the needs of the profession and the capacities of our community members.</p>
          <p>At a high level, our work aims to answer the what, why, and how of ResearchOps. We started with what in 2018; now our challenges are the how and why.</p>
          <p>We created a model for ResearchOps comprised of eight pillars. This not only comes from the voice of people around the world but helps in both near-future and ongoing work by that same community of voices:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Research Environment</li>
            <li>Research Scope</li>
            <li>Organisational Constraints</li>
            <li>People</li>
            <li>Research admin and logistics</li>
            <li>Asset and Knowledge Management</li>
            <li>Tools and Infrastructure</li>
            <li>Safety and Ethics</li>  
          </ul>
          
          <p>We are using these now to help us focus our community efforts.</p>

          <h3>Current Projects</h3>
          <p>In 2019, we’re focused on two global pieces of research aimed at helping us help researchers or helping us help ourselves. We also have several community based projects in the works.</p>

          <h2>The Board</h2>
          <p>The Board of ResearchOps (affectionately known as the Cheese Board) is a group of leaders who have taken on the role of shaping and leading the community. They are made from the original Team ReOps, formed at the end of the #WhatIsResearchOps workshops to bring together that work and share the task of caring for the Community and harnessing all that enthusiasm for our emergent profession.</p>
          <p>In December 2018, the board grew to 13 members stretched across the globe. All of the board members are people who have been doing work in the background, the unseen stuff, the Ops for the Ops people.</p>
          <p>The board is:</p>
          <ul>
            {% for member in site.board_members %}
              <li>
                <h3>{{ member.title }}</h3> 
                <p>{{ member.content }}</p>
              </li>
            {% endfor %}
