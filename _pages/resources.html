<section class="governance">
  <h2>Governance</h2>
  <p>ResearchOps needs to provide researchers with an informed framework for conducting research that is safe, legal and ethical.</p>
  <p>Governance of Research is something that continues long after the research is done. Governance can include governance of ethics across an organisation, maintaining and developing appropriate consent forms, including records management of completed consent forms. It is undertaking risk assessments either with or for researchers. It is ensuring safe working environments for researchers. It is information security. ResearchOps includes managing privacy and Non-Disclosure Agreements.</p>

<section class="tools">
  <h2>Tools</h2>
  <p>Researchers need lots of tools. Strategic management and procurement of tools helps research to scale effectively.</p>
  <p>ResearchOps includes helping researchers source the right tools at the right time (and at scale, at the right price). It includes managing access and use of tools, including managing licences, training, onboarding and permissions.</p>
  <p>It includes management of software and hardware for researchers in the field, in labs and in the office.</p>
  <p>Kate Towsey has generously shared her list of User Research tools.</p>

<section class="knowledge-mangement">
  <h2>Knowledge management</h2>
  <p>Knowledge management is a hot topic in ResearchOps. Knowledge management is heavily intertwined with research governance and the socialisation of research. There are many, many platforms available for researchers to gather, store, synthesise and reuse their research. There are a growing number of platforms for socialising research, and a few that mix between the two.</p>
  <p>Knowledge management includes taxonomies, structured vocabularies, librarianship, It includes a strategy and a solution for surfacing and delivering insights and findings to research consumers. A good research repository, corpus or library includes one or more librarians to undertake data gardening and develop a research narrative across the organisation and across research.</p>

<section class="capability-and-opportunity">
  <h2>Capability &amp; opportunity</h2>
  <p>ResearchOps people have a role in developing researchers. Ops people are uniquely positioned to understand the breadth of research across an organisation and can therefore serve as a centralising function for capability development. This can include housing Centres of Excellence, co-designing training and career frameworks and working with research leaders to manage career development.</p>
</section>

<section class="guides-and-templates">
  <h2>Guides and templates</h2>
  <p>In the #WhatIsResearchOps workshops, the most commonly noted aspect of operations was that ResearchOps includes guides and templates – recruitment guidelines, ethics guidelines, the how-tos of research. Lots of people wanted ReOps people to help them understand if they were doing ok. If their methods and methodologies met the right standard – inside their organisations and also internationally.</p>
  <p>ResearchOps includes templates for research briefings, for research artefacts.</p>
  <p>All those guides and templates need a platform or database and someone to maintain them.</p>

<section class="event-management">
  <h2>Event management</h2>
  <p>ResearchOps people don&rsquo;t get out of the office much, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s nothing to do by way of organising events. We&rsquo;re here to help researchers do their best work, and crow loudly about it when they do. ResearchOps includes managing the logistics, tools and resources for off-site events, onsite events, team meetings, sharebacks, retros and arranging for speakers to attend events where the socialisation of research is involved.</p>
  <p>ResearchOps is as much about people and forging relationships and connections as it is about efficiency, support and data.</p>
</section>

<section class="recruitment">
  <h2>Recruitment</h2>
  <p>Recruitment is one of the most challenging aspects of conducting research. Good Ops management of recruitment includes the tools, databases and schedules but also the small things that make a difference- managing effective incentives, saying thank you. Maintaining relationships with external recruiters or with a customer panel, ensuring the participants meet the needs of the research. That means having an in-depth understanding of research and the goals of the research.</p>
</section>

<section class="asset-management">
  <h2>Asset management</h2>
  <p>Asset management is about where you store raw or processed data, whether A/V or other forms of documentation. It&rsquo;s not about making the data useful, just findable and secured. It is heavily tied in with data security. It is also about managing assets &mdash; audio recorders, video equipment.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Research spaces</h2>
  <p>Researchers do research in all kinds of places. Out in the field, in labs, in offices, in workshops. Researchers need space to move and talk. They need tools to collaborate online and offline. They need walls and tables, pens and yes, sticky notes.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Budget management</h2>
  <p>All those tools and spaces and things come at a cost. ResearchOps is about tracking operational spend and helping researchers go through budgetary processes and submissions. Strategic Operations involves working with research leadership to ensure there is sufficient budget in place to purchase or design and develop tools ahead of researcher need. There is an Ops function in tracking the impact of all of that socialisation of the research.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Socialising, communicating and evangelising about research</h2>
  <p>Researchers spend a lot of their time socialising their research and evangelising about the need for research. ResearchOps has a role to play in assisting with, or doing this socialisation work.</p>  
  <p>Where a mature knowledge structure exists, there also exists the capacity to socialise that research on behalf of researchers, taking on the complex governance of extending access to research to the right people within the boundaries of existing rules regarding ethics and consent.</p>
