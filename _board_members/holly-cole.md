When she was 8, Holly started a list of “Things that would be different if I ran the world”. Number one was: engineers who make highways should have to live there for two years before being allowed to make changes.

She’s always been focused on understanding the context before changing anything. She’s always been passionate about helping the people around her and has a bit of a catchphrase, “My users are my coworkers.” She loves to both hear and tell a good story, so don’t get her going unless you’re prepared to have seven conversations at once that don’t seem to relate to each other until the end. All that translates well into her passion of governance and process for research activities that allow everyone to do better, more rigorous research with the people they make things for, wherever they work or study.
